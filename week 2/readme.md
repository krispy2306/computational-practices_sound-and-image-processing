**2 Colour Team File**

- worked with Mikaela - I was coding while she was advising 
- followed code done in class for colour swapping
- downloaded image of a flower:
!(/Nikita - Personal/Downloads/flower.jpg)
- changed colour of image from oranges and yellows to blues and greens
- unexpected outcome: pixels did not stay blue but instead were flashing between the original and modified colours
- not sure why, but gave a cool outcome!
